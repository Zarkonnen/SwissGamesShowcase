Heubi und M.  KÃ¶hler for the Atari ST platform. War Heli is a vertical shoot 'em up  in a war setting. The player pilots a helicopter through an area where  he has to destroy all enemy tanks. He has to be careful not to hit any  ambulances. If he does so, his score gets set to zero. War Heli is a  challenging game with high standards in graphics and technique for its  time. War Heli came with a then unique feature: you could save the game  to the disk and continue later. Further artists of the Argonica team  were: T. Steimle, R. Gafner and H.P. Gysel.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Argonica</p><p>Release Date: 1987</p><p>Platforms: Atari ST</p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
