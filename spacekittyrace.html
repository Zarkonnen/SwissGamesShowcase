That's it.  Suitable for ages 5 and up.   Some more info:   The idea was to have a system the player can set up and then have it run without any interaction from the player. In terms with the theme "You only get one", the kitty has to find all the stars in one run. However the player is free to interact when the kitty isn't running. (Great huh?)   Even more info (OMG):  * There are four "tools" available: GoLeft, GoRight, Jump, Speed  * There are no limits as to how many "tools" you can place  * Running into a wall or off the level kills the kitty :(  * Protip: on the later levels there are more then one stars  * Protip: you can do tool chains for great effect</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Tobias Baumann</p><p>Release Date: 2013</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac, Web</p><p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/comment-page-2/?action%3Dpreview%26uid%3D7317">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://www.2ndsky.ch/LD28, http://www.2ndsky.ch/LD28/Space_Kitty_Race-v1_win.rar, http://www.2ndsky.ch/LD28/Space_Kitty_Race-v1_mac.zip">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
