Ships are shown in a side-on “ant farm” view, with air sailors running around, manning the guns, carrying ammo, putting out fires.  Air combat is a visceral thing: ships ram and push against each other and boarding parties use grappling hooks to invade enemy ships. Below, giant landships move on legs and tracks. Nature has its own terrors: sky krakens with tentacles that grab and devour crew, house-sized spiders and horse-sized spiderlings, dragons to fear and tame.  Can you build the strongest airships, use them skilfully, and conquer the skies?</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: David Stark</p><p>Early Access Date: 2015-02-25</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac, Linux</p><p><a href="http://zarkonnen.com/airships">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/">Steam</a></p><p><a href="http://zarkonnen.com/airships">Development Log</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
