Someone has stolen your precious diamonds! Now you have to flick and fling Spoing through 50 underground caves to get them back in this platforming adventure! Each level in Spoing is a whole new challenge! Climb through the caverns as quick as you can, but watch out for bats, chameleons, spitting enemies and those sharp cave walls!  Trapped in a cave the only hope for the player is to search the exit. Spoing plays in a wonderful looking and amazing underground world.  Spoing is all about launching a ball from floating slingshots until a goal is reached within a limited time. The player can create slingshots by himself by clicking twice. This has never been done before in a Slingshot game and is a unique and very nice feature. In advanced levels the player creates his own path through entire levels with nothing but self created slingshots.  The player creates his own unique music by playing Spoing. When shooting the ball, the slingshot acts like a piano-string and produces a sound. Big slingshots create deep sounds and short slingshots higher ones, hence when moving through a level the player creates his own little melody.  Highlights * Explore fifty different caverns infested by a horde of oddball enemies. * Accessible flick controls allow anybody to play. * Stark, stylish art makes Spoing a treat for eyes as well as your fingers. * Put your best times up on the leaderboard or go for a wealth of achievements. * Listen to the great in-game soundtrack or rock your own tunes.  </p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: games2be</p><p>Release Date: 2011</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Facebook</p><p><a href="http://games2be.com/projects/spoing-2/">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.games2be.spoing">Play Store</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spoing/id408845424?mt=8&uo=4">App Store</a></p><p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/games2be">Twitter</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
