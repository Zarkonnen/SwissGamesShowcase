During a stormy night visions of a great drought hunt your dreams.  You wake up realizing you have only 200 days left to gather enough food or your citizens will starve and perish. In shock you speak to your advisors but they don't believe you.   Are you willing to sacrifice the goodwill of your people in order to save them?   As it was foretold in your vision you must gather 5'000 counts of food before the end of 200 days in order to save your kingdom.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Tobias Baumann</p><p>Release Date: 2012</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac, Web</p><p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7317">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7317">Download</a></p><p><a href="http://www.2ndsky.ch/LD25/LD25_You_Are_The_King_Source.rar">Source</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
