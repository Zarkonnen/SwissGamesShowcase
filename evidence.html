You’ll have to travel through teddy bears corpses lying all over a strange place. Nobody seems to love you, except for that strange post-it following you everywhere. But be careful, he doesn't seem to always tell the truth. There’s a lot of ennemies, all weird ones. Don’t be afraid, there’s one unique way to escape from each of them.  Everything you'll encounter can be explained. Jump, run and hide yourself until you reach the end of your journey, then everything will be fine, perhaps…</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Wuthrer</p><p>Release Date: 2011-12-03</p><p>Platforms: PC</p><p><a href="http://wuthrer.net/evidence/">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14394369/Evidence.zip">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
