It focuses on the bacterium pikselum. The bacterium was discovered in 1985 in the USSR by the scientist Lars Rodkov. He first thought he found a glitch in a bootleg of river raid (an atari 2600 game). But then he discovered, that it was a bacterium living in displays. PikselBacteria are feeding on pixel-edges. They are very rare. Therefore Rodkov developed an attractor to approach and cultivate these bacteria.   Based on his research, And-or developed a game in which you may grow these short-lived bacteria with your camera.   You breed the short-lived bacteria with your camera. Give them food by taking them to an edge and start moving the camera along this edge - and the bacteria will breed instantly and take you to the edge.   Gain research points in growing the bacteria as long as you can!</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: and-or</p><p>Release Date: 2012</p><p>Platforms: iOS</p><p><a href="http://www.pikselbacteria.ch/">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pikselbacteria/id525517315">App Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
