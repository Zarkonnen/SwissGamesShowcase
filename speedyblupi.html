He uses various means of transport: helicopter, skate, car, or teleporter. He has to avoid many traps: ravines, bombs, lava, glue, saws, etc. He moves boxes, activates switches, unlocks gates and uses dynamic sticks, all these things in order to reach his precious treasures. On his way, heâ€™ll find potions and lollipops which will help him in his quest. A funny game with an increasing difficulty requiring skill and reflection</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Dada Games</p><p>Release Date: 2013-01-15</p><p>Platforms: Windows phone</p><p><a href="http://app4smart.com/en/wp/2957-speedy-blupi.html">Other Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
