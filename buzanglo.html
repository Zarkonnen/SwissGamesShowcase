But things aren’t going to go as planned… Bužanglo which in the Romanes language means both unknown and clever, is a serious game for young people aged 12 to 15. Its goal? To fight clichés about the Roma, the population that is most discriminated against in Europe today. Based on the (real) life stories of 13 Roma in Switzerland, the game aims to give a more complex picture of this population in order to overcome the prejudices that concern them. Is there as much diversity among the Roma as among the Swiss, the French or the Germans? Thanks to a poetic world that looks like a comic strip, immerse yourself in a world that is both imaginary and very real through the situations experienced by the characters. Discover their diverse and intriguing stories, video interviews and fact sheets to acquire and test your knowledge.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Collective project between Myth_n, Aprobado, Digital Kingdom, HEAD – Geneva, HETSL and HEP – Vaud</p><p>Release Date: 2019-01-11</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac, iOS, Android</p><p><a href="http://www.buzanglo.org/">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://www.buzanglo.org/">Download</a></p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bu%C5%BEanglo/id1401859903?l=fr&ls=1">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.aprobado.hesso.head.citoyensmitoyens">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
