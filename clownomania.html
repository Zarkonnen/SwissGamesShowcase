To reach it, he needs to solve 82 isometric levels by collecting all balls and diamonds spread out over the tiles. The levels also have different plains which are changed by either using a ladder or jumping. However, jumps and shots for his gun need to be picked up first - which is made more difficult by the fact that the symbols move over the level. </p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Roman Rossart, Roman Werner</p><p>Publisher: Starbyte</p><p>Release Date: 1989</p><p>Platforms: Amiga, Atari ST</p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
