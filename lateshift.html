It has one beginning – but countless possible storylines and seven different endings. Matt, a smart student, has to prove his innocence after being forced into the robbery of a famous London auction house. How will the audience decide to act when everything is turning against him? The audience takes decisions for the interactive thriller’s hero while the movie keeps on running seamlessly. This time it’s different. This time you leave the theatre knowing that if you watched the movie again, you could see a different story. What if you’re dissatisfied with the consequences of the audience’s collective decisions? Then, in the form of the app, the protagonist’s fate is in your hands alone. It is up to you to discover countless variations of the same plot and make “better” decisions.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: CtrlMovie&Söhne</p><p>Release Date: 2016</p><p>Platforms: iOS</p><p><a href="http://lateshift-movie.com/">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id886526292">App Store</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/lateshift_movie">Twitter</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
