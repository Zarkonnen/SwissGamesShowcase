In 2048 the "International Roof Running League" (IRRL) dominates the worldwide sporting events calendar. Every week tough races are held high up on the roofs of cities.  Athletes not only have to take part in IRRL's competitions, they also have to train and there is the risk of a random drug test, the same as faces professional athletes. Of course, as in real life, there exist rankings of the best players worldwide and of each country. Doped players lose points, their name is published on the Wall of Shame and they can be banned from taking part in the IRRL, after which they have to start all over again.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Feinheit, Blindflug Studios</p><p>Sponsor: Antidoping.ch</p><p>Release Date: 2013</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android</p><p><a href="http://www.antidoping.ch/en/prevention/mobile-learning-programs/born-run-mobile-game">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.feinheit.games.BornToRunCH">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
