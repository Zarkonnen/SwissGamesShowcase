You control the thoughts and the actions of Barbara Krausse, as she is interrogated by the Stasi, the secret state police. The reason for her arrest remains unknown to Barbara and to you. As the player, you must try and figure out the reason while constantly fighting the temptation to give in or stand against the system!</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Pulkit Singh</p><p>Early Access Date: 2020-06-19</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac</p><p><a href="https://pulkitoki.itch.io/xv1986">itch.io</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
