Their task is to find out why their subsidiary company on another planet is not making any financial progress. The player has to collect any clues that are important for a potential restructuring progress. They will be confronted with different personal and business problems while finding out what is happening. Depending on what is discovered and which clues are brought back to the holding company, the player will get feedback on what the final restructuring process will change and how well the problems have been addressed.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Koboldgames</p><p>Sponsor: Center for Ethics and  Department of Banking&Finance, University of Zurich, Chair of  Economic Psychology and Leadership Ethics Zeppelin University  Friedrichshafen</p><p>Release Date: 2018-11</p><p>Platforms: Android</p><p><a href="https://koboldgames.ch/project/ufin">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Koboldgames">Twitter</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
