Ships are shown in a side-on “ant farm” view, with air sailors running around, manning the guns, carrying ammo, putting out fires.  Air combat is a visceral thing: ships ram and push against each other and boarding parties use grappling hooks to invade enemy ships. Below, giant landships move on legs and tracks. Nature has its own terrors: sky krakens with tentacles that grab and devour crew, house-sized spiders and horse-sized spiderlings, dragons to fear and tame.  Can you build the strongest airships, use them skilfully, and conquer the skies?

Actual experiments to create new types of honeybees that can resist certain parasites have been conducted. In our version, we played with the idea of a robotic bee that is sent into beehives in order to exterminate the hostile parasites within.  In traditional roguelike manner, we intended for the game to be difficult to master. In the end however, we managed that a bit too well and have created a game that borders on frustration in its difficulty.   The player moves from room to hexagonal room in a level, only able to leave rooms once all enemies within have been defeated. In some rooms, the player will encounter sick honeybees that can only be cured by draining life force from still living enemies.		
Before the Satellite detects you	beforethesatellitedetectsyou	iPhone	http://www.and-or.ch/beforethesatellite/	and-or					2010														https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk426Kmby7U		http://www.and-or.ch/beforethesatellite/pictures/screenshot.png		Before the satellite detects you! is a locative and adaptive game for mobile devices. Our first build is for the iphone. The work plays with the scary concept that every one of us can be traced by satellites at any time. Big Brother is literally watching us already with the eyes of the satellites high above us. Our game proofs this and plays with it. A GPS-satelllite tracks you and your iphone. Is the signal strong, the iphone shows a red locator mark on the local map of your city. This means you have to find a place where the satellite cannot trace you. If you manage to find the shade of a tall building or sneak into a doorway, go to a subway passage, into a basement, the signal weakens considerably and you may hide from the satellite for a while. Try to make your way to the destination in town while outrunning the satellite. You set the destination yourself, it is where you meet a friend. Once set, you have to reach the destination in a certain time without being detected by the satellite!

It`s a simple and strong story. People in every culture and of every age or social background have dreams of flying. It does not take many words to get involved: it‘s the experience that matters!  Birdly is an immersive, full body installation born out of a research project. It explores the experience of a bird in flight and was developed by the Zurich University of the Arts (ZhdK). Unlike a common flight simulator you do not control a machine - you intuitively embody a bird. To evoke this sensation, Birdly relies on sensory-motor coupling and truly 3D visuals provided by a state of the art head mounted display. Birdly combines extended forms of storytelling with strong visuals and technical perfection to create a unique and intuitive experience.

In 2048 the "International Roof Running League" (IRRL) dominates the worldwide sporting events calendar. Every week tough races are held high up on the roofs of cities.

Doped players lose points, their name is published on the Wall of Shame and they can be banned from taking part in the IRRL, after which they have to start all over again.

The GameArt project features some serious defects. It visualizes discrimination/racism, makes it playable and very tangible. The player experiences discrimination/racism first-hand while trying to establish a win in this unfair variation of Pong. The 'not so white-paddle' is discriminated in several aspects: from its visuals and its movements to the overall gamemechanic of the game. It is very hard for the discriminated player to win a match. Discrimination is implemented in different ways: the 'not-so-white-paddle' gets darker and darker. The left paddle may be slower than the right one. The ball may accelerate on the left side of the playground and become too fast to catch in time. The white paddle on the right may receive an extra ball without deserving it. And maybe worst of all, the ball never touches the right wall or paddle but loops slowly back to the left and takes on a faster pace as soon as it reaches the left side of the playground again. A very unfair game indeed! Find out what types of discrimination/racism you have to expect in DISCRIMINATION PONG.

The asymmetric controls force the players to communicate and develop strategies to solve puzzles. The players are challenged by a variety of ever changing level designs and mechanics.

Made for kids, teens, and adults, Silly World Series allows you to have some fun with your competitive side. You can try it out during your next party, get-together, reunion, or lunch break. It’s a completely addictive game that really tests your skills – once you get started, you won’t want to stop!  In this interactive game, you can choose one of eight different characters to play. Will you choose the Sparkly Rainbow Unicorn? Or maybe the Silly Hammerhead Shark? Silly World Series takes its players on a world trip through SillyLand, from the roaring Lachrymal Falls to the bubbly Verdant Swamp, from Red Stripe Canyon to Sharkfin Bay. Each of their diverse game settings are colorful, silly, and definitely amusing. All you need to get started is a smartphone, laptop (or smart TV), and an internet connection.  Just like any other platform, AirConsole is always developing the latest video games to provide you with the best entertainment for you so that you can play anytime, anyplace, and with any group of people. As of now, there are five games available for you and many more games are coming on board soon. So sit tight because you will not want to miss out on any of them.   1.  SILLY RUN VALLEY: It’s a long race to the finish line! To play this Silly World Series game, all you have to do is swipe up and down on your smartphone, which will allow you to stop your character from running into obstacles on the big screen. You also have to be on the lookout for the Bomb Bug, otherwise you may fall behind. Our advice is for you to shake them off, or most preferably you should pass them off to your competitors since the main aim of the game is for you to win. How far can you run?  2.  THE HUNGRY GAMES: The Hungry Games are all about reaction. If you are the type that loves fruit, then we just found the game for you. With this game, all you have to do is be the first to take down all the fruit that appears in the swamp to beat your friends and become the winner. However, you must be very careful because if you eat before you look, then you might end up catching a bomb instead. This will cause you to get knocked out of the game for a little while.  3.  CLIFF HANGER:  How good are you at dodging? Because you are going to be doing a lot of that with this mini-game in the Silly World Series! It is all about scaling rocks which protrude from the Lachrymal Waterfalls. All you have to do is swipe or move in the right direction to avoid colliding with the rocks. Making even just one wrong move can make you fall and lose the game.  4.  DERPY DANCING:  How confident are you with your memories? If you think your memory is as strong as a rock, then you should try this mini-game out. Derpy Dancing takes you directly to the sandy beaches of Sharkfin Bay, and this great game is all about putting your short term memory to the test!  Do you think you can remember more than your friends?  5.  HIDE AND SNEAK: How sneaky are you? Can you be as sneaky as the Great Tiger? Then you should put your sneakiness to the test with this game. You have to be the first to reach the grumpy turtle, Agnes, just to catch a ride with her across the Skeltara Desert. You have to tap repeatedly as fast as you possibly can to sneak up on her. But be careful to stop tapping on time so as to stop just about when she is about to look back. Test your timing and your agility with this fun Silly World Series game.  HOW TO PLAY SILLY WORLD SERIES WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS  You may have been wondering and asking yourself how exactly do you play these games and how to include your family and friends? This is pretty simple. Hit the green “start” button on your desktop in the middle of the screen. The larger screen will then display a code. Access airconsole.com from your phone’s browser and enter the same code. This connects your smartphone and enables you to use it as your game controller. To include your group, all they have to do is enter the same exact code. Then you’ll be able to play on the same screen!  No extra hardware or software is required. You only need one smartphone per player. You can play the games by yourself or with eight people comfortably without any problems. So what are you waiting for? Now you can play multiplayer games together. Pick your favorite characters and get started playing Silly World Series today!

That's it.  Suitable for ages 5 and up.   Some more info:   The idea was to have a system the player can set up and then have it run without any interaction from the player. In terms with the theme "You only get one", the kitty has to find all the stars in one run. However the player is free to interact when the kitty isn't running. (Great huh?)   Even more info (OMG):  * There are four "tools" available: GoLeft, GoRight, Jump, Speed  * There are no limits as to how many "tools" you can place  * Running into a wall or off the level kills the kitty :(  * Protip: on the later levels there are more then one stars  * Protip: you can do tool chains for great effect

Help the hungry spider to catch as many of the insects as possible. With your finger or the S-Pen, you can aim for the tree trunks and let the spider jump between them. Each jump will leave a sticky web behind, which entangles enemies and lets you jump on it again. Use your head and your dexterity as you build up your own cobweb and see the tasty bugs getting devoured.		https://www.facebook.com/SplinkGame

Someone has stolen your precious diamonds! Now you have to flick and fling Spoing through 50 underground caves to get them back in this platforming adventure! Each level in Spoing is a whole new challenge! Climb through the caverns as quick as you can, but watch out for bats, chameleons, spitting enemies and those sharp cave walls!  Trapped in a cave the only hope for the player is to search the exit. Spoing plays in a wonderful looking and amazing underground world.  Spoing is all about launching a ball from floating slingshots until a goal is reached within a limited time. The player can create slingshots by himself by clicking twice. This has never been done before in a Slingshot game and is a unique and very nice feature. In advanced levels the player creates his own path through entire levels with nothing but self created slingshots.  The player creates his own unique music by playing Spoing. When shooting the ball, the slingshot acts like a piano-string and produces a sound. Big slingshots create deep sounds and short slingshots higher ones, hence when moving through a level the player creates his own little melody.  Highlights * Explore fifty different caverns infested by a horde of oddball enemies. * Accessible flick controls allow anybody to play. * Stark, stylish art makes Spoing a treat for eyes as well as your fingers. * Put your best times up on the leaderboard or go for a wealth of achievements. * Listen to the great in-game soundtrack or rock your own tunes.

Streamf1sh1ng depicts a real-life pattern by pulling together individual fragments of reality into a virtual image. The fragments of reality are thoughts merged into a constant stream of words and thoughts. Making this stream of thoughts visible enables the individual thoughts to interact which each other. This means: the virtual image or world is revealed as an interactive reality of human being and machine and can be used for further communication and exchange of ideas.  You are fishing in a constant stream of thoughts. Catch someone else's thought and put it in your bucket or throw your own idea into the stream and see what happens. The constant stream is supplied by means of a search-engine. Any input in this particular search-engine will show up in the stream. Try to communicate via search-engine.
