As we've put quite a lot of effort into this, we decided to work a little harder on it and turn it out as a freeware game. Actually, it's more a sort of a party game. Instead of fighting against spaceships (as in other conventional shoot 'em up games), you have to shoot beer bottles, barrels, whisky glasses, aspirin pills and so on. As we grew up in the middle of Switzerland (ZUG, Innerschweiz), we first started drinking EICHHOF beer (you could also say we grew up with this beer !!). The kind of beer you started with is mostly the beer you like best, as you probably know, and so we decided to dedicate our game to the good old Brewery of Eichhof in Luzern. We also think that you shouldn't support the very big breweries (I guess you know which breweries we mean) and that's why we also built up a little background story for this game.			released	9221

There are two teams. You either play as an overweight WW2 pilot in the survivor team or as a suicider disguised as a pot plant in the suicider team.  The goal for the survivors is to stay alive and to spot the suiciders. They have a couple of throw-able copies of the book: “Gardening for Beginners – by Barbara Bush” as a self-defense weapon.  The goal for suiciders is to sneak up close enough to the survivors in order to blow themselves up. Because each map is full of shrubberies its very hard to spot a real suicidal pot plant among the many fake ones. If a shrubbery isn’t moving, you can’t tell if he is being controlled by another player or not.  Currently the game doesn’t have any other goal then being simple team deathmatch. However it still is a lot of fun and you should definitely try it out with a few friends.			released	8120

At first he can only go to the practice level, where he will learn most of the controls listed above. The rest of the controls are not shown to during the practice game; they are left for the player to discover these moves while passing through the levels. The game has over 40 levels, ranging from easy to relatively difficult. The objective of each level is to collect all the treasure chests and then move to the endpoint. The game includes enemies which Eggbert cannot destroy normally, but can be destroyed using vehicles. The game lets Eggbert drive a Helicopter, a Glue Tank, a Jeep and a Skateboard. The Jeep and Skateboard allow Eggbert to travel past mines and detonate them without losing a life. Glue balls can be collected by Eggbert, where they can be fired as weapons from the Glue Tank or Helicopter to defeat enemies. There are also deductive problems to be solved and errors may make finishing the level impossible.	Daniel Roux		released	8140

Made for kids, teens, and adults, Silly World Series allows you to have some fun with your competitive side. You can try it out during your next party, get-together, reunion, or lunch break. It’s a completely addictive game that really tests your skills – once you get started, you won’t want to stop!  In this interactive game, you can choose one of eight different characters to play. Will you choose the Sparkly Rainbow Unicorn? Or maybe the Silly Hammerhead Shark? Silly World Series takes its players on a world trip through SillyLand, from the roaring Lachrymal Falls to the bubbly Verdant Swamp, from Red Stripe Canyon to Sharkfin Bay. Each of their diverse game settings are colorful, silly, and definitely amusing. All you need to get started is a smartphone, laptop (or smart TV), and an internet connection.  Just like any other platform, AirConsole is always developing the latest video games to provide you with the best entertainment for you so that you can play anytime, anyplace, and with any group of people. As of now, there are five games available for you and many more games are coming on board soon. So sit tight because you will not want to miss out on any of them.   1.  SILLY RUN VALLEY: It’s a long race to the finish line! To play this Silly World Series game, all you have to do is swipe up and down on your smartphone, which will allow you to stop your character from running into obstacles on the big screen. You also have to be on the lookout for the Bomb Bug, otherwise you may fall behind. Our advice is for you to shake them off, or most preferably you should pass them off to your competitors since the main aim of the game is for you to win. How far can you run?  2.  THE HUNGRY GAMES: The Hungry Games are all about reaction. If you are the type that loves fruit, then we just found the game for you. With this game, all you have to do is be the first to take down all the fruit that appears in the swamp to beat your friends and become the winner. However, you must be very careful because if you eat before you look, then you might end up catching a bomb instead. This will cause you to get knocked out of the game for a little while.  3.  CLIFF HANGER:  How good are you at dodging? Because you are going to be doing a lot of that with this mini-game in the Silly World Series! It is all about scaling rocks which protrude from the Lachrymal Waterfalls. All you have to do is swipe or move in the right direction to avoid colliding with the rocks. Making even just one wrong move can make you fall and lose the game.  4.  DERPY DANCING:  How confident are you with your memories? If you think your memory is as strong as a rock, then you should try this mini-game out. Derpy Dancing takes you directly to the sandy beaches of Sharkfin Bay, and this great game is all about putting your short term memory to the test!  Do you think you can remember more than your friends?  5.  HIDE AND SNEAK: How sneaky are you? Can you be as sneaky as the Great Tiger? Then you should put your sneakiness to the test with this game. You have to be the first to reach the grumpy turtle, Agnes, just to catch a ride with her across the Skeltara Desert. You have to tap repeatedly as fast as you possibly can to sneak up on her. But be careful to stop tapping on time so as to stop just about when she is about to look back. Test your timing and your agility with this fun Silly World Series game.  HOW TO PLAY SILLY WORLD SERIES WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS  You may have been wondering and asking yourself how exactly do you play these games and how to include your family and friends? This is pretty simple. Hit the green “start” button on your desktop in the middle of the screen. The larger screen will then display a code. Access airconsole.com from your phone’s browser and enter the same code. This connects your smartphone and enables you to use it as your game controller. To include your group, all they have to do is enter the same exact code. Then you’ll be able to play on the same screen!  No extra hardware or software is required. You only need one smartphone per player. You can play the games by yourself or with eight people comfortably without any problems. So what are you waiting for? Now you can play multiplayer games together. Pick your favorite characters and get started playing Silly World Series today!			released	7140

There are a large number of "Tower Defense" games but in most of them, creatures move on a fixed path. In this game there is no predefined path, you must slow the creatures strategically to prevent them from reaching your castle. To achieve this, the player can place the towers on the ground to force the creatures to move in another path. Thus the player can determine the path that the creatures will follow.			released	7110

The GameArt project features some serious defects. It visualizes discrimination/racism, makes it playable and very tangible. The player experiences discrimination/racism first-hand while trying to establish a win in this unfair variation of Pong. The 'not so white-paddle' is discriminated in several aspects: from its visuals and its movements to the overall gamemechanic of the game. It is very hard for the discriminated player to win a match. Discrimination is implemented in different ways: the 'not-so-white-paddle' gets darker and darker. The left paddle may be slower than the right one. The ball may accelerate on the left side of the playground and become too fast to catch in time. The white paddle on the right may receive an extra ball without deserving it. And maybe worst of all, the ball never touches the right wall or paddle but loops slowly back to the left and takes on a faster pace as soon as it reaches the left side of the playground again. A very unfair game indeed! Find out what types of discrimination/racism you have to expect in DISCRIMINATION PONG. 			released	7110

Actual experiments to create new types of honeybees that can resist certain parasites have been conducted. In our version, we played with the idea of a robotic bee that is sent into beehives in order to exterminate the hostile parasites within.  In traditional roguelike manner, we intended for the game to be difficult to master. In the end however, we managed that a bit too well and have created a game that borders on frustration in its difficulty.   The player moves from room to hexagonal room in a level, only able to leave rooms once all enemies within have been defeated. In some rooms, the player will encounter sick honeybees that can only be cured by draining life force from still living enemies.			released	7110

Ships are shown in a side-on “ant farm” view, with air sailors running around, manning the guns, carrying ammo, putting out fires.  Air combat is a visceral thing: ships ram and push against each other and boarding parties use grappling hooks to invade enemy ships. Below, giant landships move on legs and tracks. Nature has its own terrors: sky krakens with tentacles that grab and devour crew, house-sized spiders and horse-sized spiderlings, dragons to fear and tame.

Someone has stolen your precious diamonds! Now you have to flick and fling Spoing through 50 underground caves to get them back in this platforming adventure! Each level in Spoing is a whole new challenge! Climb through the caverns as quick as you can, but watch out for bats, chameleons, spitting enemies and those sharp cave walls!  Trapped in a cave the only hope for the player is to search the exit. Spoing plays in a wonderful looking and amazing underground world.  Spoing is all about launching a ball from floating slingshots until a goal is reached within a limited time. The player can create slingshots by himself by clicking twice. This has never been done before in a Slingshot game and is a unique and very nice feature. In advanced levels the player creates his own path through entire levels with nothing but self created slingshots.  The player creates his own unique music by playing Spoing. When shooting the ball, the slingshot acts like a piano-string and produces a sound. Big slingshots create deep sounds and short slingshots higher ones, hence when moving through a level the player creates his own little melody.  Highlights * Explore fifty different caverns infested by a horde of oddball enemies. * Accessible flick controls allow anybody to play. * Stark, stylish art makes Spoing a treat for eyes as well as your fingers. * Put your best times up on the leaderboard or go for a wealth of achievements. * Listen to the great in-game soundtrack or rock your own tunes.  			released	6231

It focuses on the bacterium pikselum. The bacterium was discovered in 1985 in the USSR by the scientist Lars Rodkov. He first thought he found a glitch in a bootleg of river raid (an atari 2600 game). But then he discovered, that it was a bacterium living in displays. PikselBacteria are feeding on pixel-edges. They are very rare. Therefore Rodkov developed an attractor to approach and cultivate these bacteria.   Based on his research, And-or developed a game in which you may grow these short-lived bacteria with your camera.   You breed the short-lived bacteria with your camera. Give them food by taking them to an edge and start moving the camera along this edge - and the bacteria will breed instantly and take you to the edge.   Gain research points in growing the bacteria as long as you can!			released	6210

It extends the use of the rehabilitation robot "Lokomat®", a gait orthosis machine into which children are strapped for sessions of variable duration, changing it from a tool into a game controller.    INTENTION  GABARELLO v1.0 animates therapy for children with lower body motor loss. Before GABARELLO v1.0, therapeutic motivation was achieved through individual therapists. The game exploitsthe potential of immersion, and integrating an Augmented Feedback Module to make therapy a stimulating, self-motivated, fun experience. GAME CONTROL & INTERFACE  GABARELLO v1.0 is kept deliberately simple to account for potential brain trauma or visual limitation of the patient, and ease of use by the therapist. The interface is a game screen attached to the biofeedback computer of the Lokomat . The game is controlled by the force of the movement of the child in the Lokomat . The level design of the game requires deliberate changes in exertion of the patient and thus meets therapeutic goals. As with most immersive games, GABARELLO v1.0 triggers brain problem-solving functions: the child is able to anticipate what s/he will do differently next time, and experiences positive rehabilitative effects for the brain as well as the body. GAME PLAY & MECHANICS  The avatar explores the surface of a curious planet and collects objects. The avatar's shape varies according to the intensity of effort of the controlling child. The visual feedback of the intensity is displayed through the shifting height, colour and speed of the avatar. More intensive biofeedback improves the avatar's abilities. CURRENT STATE  GABARELLO v1.0 has been in daily use for evaluation at the University Children's Hospital Zurich since December 2009.

In terms with the theme "You only get one", the kitty has to find all the stars in one run. However the player is free to interact when the kitty isn't running. (Great huh?)   Even more info (OMG):  * There are four "tools" available: GoLeft, GoRight, Jump, Speed  * There are no limits as to how many "tools" you can place  * Running into a wall or off the level kills the kitty :(  * Protip: on the later levels there are more then one stars  * Protip: you can do tool chains for great effect			released	6120

It`s a simple and strong story. People in every culture and of every age or social background have dreams of flying. It does not take many words to get involved: it‘s the experience that matters!  Birdly is an immersive, full body installation born out of a research project. It explores the experience of a bird in flight and was developed by the Zurich University of the Arts (ZhdK). Unlike a common flight simulator you do not control a machine - you intuitively embody a bird. To evoke this sensation, Birdly relies on sensory-motor coupling and truly 3D visuals provided by a state of the art head mounted display. Birdly combines extended forms of storytelling with strong visuals and technical perfection to create a unique and intuitive experience.			released	6120

For instance, if he presses B, Blupi will take a Bath. What's more, each action is brought up by a short sentence. Some actions lead to simple games : Draw with fun tools. Recognize numbers.

Our first build is for the iphone. The work plays with the scary concept that every one of us can be traced by satellites at any time. Big Brother is literally watching us already with the eyes of the satellites high above us. Our game proofs this and plays with it. A GPS-satelllite tracks you and your iphone. Is the signal strong, the iphone shows a red locator mark on the local map of your city. This means you have to find a place where the satellite cannot trace you. If you manage to find the shade of a tall building or sneak into a doorway, go to a subway passage, into a basement, the signal weakens considerably and you may hide from the satellite for a while. Try to make your way to the destination in town while outrunning the satellite. You set the destination yourself, it is where you meet a friend. Once set, you have to reach the destination in a certain time without being detected by the satellite! 			released	6110

The famous writer and dramatist broke war down into the simple formula: never put the enemy in question. But what happens if there isn't an enemy anymore? If all of a sudden the enemy is amiss? Down in the bunker systems under the Himalayas time came to a standstill. Soldier 23 had battled his way through the rèduit systems of Switzerland and through wartorn neighbour areas during the war. He leaves his government behind, dozing in its federal parliament building bunker, deep down under the Blümlisalp mountain, and moves on to Tibet as a mercenary. There he finds new work and what is more important new enemies. The tunnels are littered with corpses, and eventually he has to finish off his former commander. "Hänschen, durchlöche mich mal!" (Little Jack, please put bullet holes in me!) he says. Or is it just an illusion? The endless killing? The steadily spawned new enemies? Killing or not killing. There is no choice! There is no escape from the (game-)labyrinth! The labyrinth quite simply is the location for experiments. A location at which only Minotaur waits or according to Dürrenmatt your alter ego awaits you. There is no other way but shooting the others; all of the rest. In the underground systems of the Himalayas the corpses pile up. Soldier 23 has to substitute his legs with rolls and his arms with weapons. In the end, all that remains for him is scribble on the wall, meter for meter, back and forth. laichenberg means mountain of spawning (german: "laichen") and piles of corpses (german: "Leichen"). In an apocalypse it shows how a simple defect alters a game. laichenberg does not make the dead disappear such as firstperson shooters usually do. The effect is that soon enough there is no space left in the labyrinth to play anymore.			released	6110

Each of the players has to choose one of the two protagonists. One character is controlled with the mouse, the other one with the keyboard or a gamepad. Together trapped in a world of abstract shapes and elements, there is not much explained but a lot to be discovered. Each chamber needs to be explored, touched, listened to or be observed in order to reach the exit. FLUX brings a new approch to a local coop experience. The asymmetric controls force the players to communicate and develop strategies to solve puzzles. The players are challenged by a variety of ever changing level designs and mechanics.			released	5131

Farewell	farewell	iOS		Miriam Wissel																			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1eEYCmA5og				Storyline: The main character of Farewell is a young Inuit who involuntarily sets out on an adventurous quest. One day, when he goes fishing, he tries to cast his angling rod but the hook gets tangled up in his shoe. The boy falls over, hits his head on the ice, and looses consciousness. His head hit the ice so hard that as he is lying there, an ice-floe separates from the mainland and drifts out into the open sea. After a long journey halfway across the globe, he runs ashore on a mystical island in the middle of the ocean. The gamer’s task now is to collect various items and use them in a way that will enable the Inuit to escape from the island. If this task is completed successfully, the Inuit moves on to another island, which he will try to escape from again. Thus begins a journey that will take the gamer to a variety of small, atmospheric worlds which will challenge him or her with a number of sophisticated and humorous riddles.			released	3110
