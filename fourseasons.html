It improves the physical and cognitive abilities and especially trains functions used for gait stability in older adults with an impaired mobility. With the help of sensors positioned in the plate, motion and forces are recorded and used for training. The players have to react to the game on the screen and translate their reaction to the correct movement of the body. Furthermore, the game input can be monitored and used for automatic adjustment of the difficulty in the game or recorded for the evaluation by the physician.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Koboldgames</p><p>Sponsor: Dividat</p><p>Release Date: 2016-10-25</p><p>Platforms: Windows/Dividat Senso</p><p><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/54503607/Four-Seasons">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Koboldgames">Twitter</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
