Centuries ago mysterious creatures lived here in their bizarre labyrinth-like dwellings. To repel burglars, many deadly traps were installed.  Looking for an exit, Kribl is straying through this ghost town on the marsh...  Ynth is a clever new jump & turn game for iPhone and iPod Touch. It combines puzzle and 2d jump & run elements to a fascinating game that is easy to pick up and stays entertaining and challenging for hours.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: krabl.com</p><p>Release Date: 2009</p><p>Platforms: iOS</p><p><a href="http://www.krabl.com/krabl/ynth.html">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=325380165&mt=8">App Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
