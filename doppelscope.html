The game can also be considered an experimental playground and simulation our world.  Doppelscope is divided into small cubical worlds. The goal in each world is to restore a given misbalance by reconnecting and moving the things presented in the world. Of course the solution isn't always the obvious one and there is plenty of room for experimentation.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Tobias Baumann</p><p>Release Date: 2009</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac</p><p>Awards: Unity Awards 2009 Best Visual Design</p><p><a href="http://www.doppelscope.com/">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://www.doppelscope.com/">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
