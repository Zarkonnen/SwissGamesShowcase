FoxTrotte is all about getting back what was once stolen.   Mr. Fox is a cheese lover, and while sitting quietly in a calm and beautiful park in London he will get his delicious meal stolen by a silly and sneaky crow. Little does he know that Mr. Crow is not afraid flying around the whole world to escape his anger and hunger.   FoxTrotte is a runner based game where you will have to chase the crow through different countries. Of course, many obstacles will cross your path. But don't worry, you also have a few abilities in your pocket.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: WitchLake Studio</p><p>Release Date: 2015</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android, Facebook</p><p><a href="https://www.witchlake.ch/foxtrotte">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/foxtrotte/id933127825?mt=8">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.witchlake.Foxtrotte">Play Store</a>, <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/foxtrotte/">Other Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
