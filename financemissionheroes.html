The papers are overflowing with news like "Our city is overrun with Robos and they are after our bank accounts!" Almost everything has been hacked already: your savings, the account of your parents as well as the one of your granny. They are struggling to even pay the rent! The Robos aren't stopping for anything. When they, one afternoon, break into your school to get your class savings, a few courageous students are forming a counter movement. Become a hero of the night and put an end to the burglaries without your parents noticing. And who knows, maybe you'll be the one to put an end to all this nonsense.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Blindflug Studios</p><p>Release Date: 2016-05-12</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android, Browser, PC, Mac</p><p>Awards: Best of Swiss Apps - Games Bronze</p><p><a href="http://www.blindflugstudios.com/our-games/finance-mission-heroes/">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blindflugstudios.fmh">Play Store</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/financemission-heroes/id1072309188">App Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
