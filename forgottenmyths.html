He also lost his trident, the symbol of his ineluctable power. Apollo, exiled to earth at the same time, enchanted and manipulated Ares, the God of War, and pushed him to create a temporary but sacred weapon able to defeat the Gods themselves. Now begins the forgotten myth about Poseidon and his water-sword.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Dot.invasion</p><p>Release Date: 2004</p><p>Platforms: Browser</p><p><a href="http://www.dot-invasion.com/dinv/portfolio/forgotten_myths.html">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
