All of a sudden the ground started shaking and his fairy folk were transformed into evil blocks, which seal his path home. Help the mighty Fairy King to find his way back to the fairy kingdom. Use the force of his magic wand to release the enchanted blocks, for the survival of the mighty Fairy King and his people lies now in your hands.  </p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: couch developers</p><p>Release Date: 2014</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android, WP8</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CouchDevelopers.FairyKingFree">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CouchDevelopers.FairyKingFree">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
