Instead of playing against each other, this game is all about surviving as a team! Players work together to defend the Kingâ€™s castle against an array of magical creatures, including large giants with looming green eyes. To survive in this game, players need to come up with strategies, such as maneuvering equipment, collecting ammunition, firing on attackers, managing everything the group needs, and making sure they stay alive.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Julie Baechtold, Nicolas Matter, Xavier Heimgartner</p><p>Release Date: 2015</p><p>Platforms: AirConsole</p><p><a href="https://www.airconsole.com/play/party-games/castle-hustle">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
