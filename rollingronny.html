Take Rolling Ronny - he's the coolest dude in town. Help him rollerskate and shoot his way through nine levels of parkland, city streets, office complexes and even the underground sewers to his final destination at the other side of town. Collect cash by running errands for the inhabitants of this weird and wonderful town to earn enough money for a bus ticket to the next part of this barmy game.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Ren√© Straub, Orlando Petermann</p><p>Publisher: Starbyte</p><p>Release Date: 1991</p><p>Platforms: Amiga</p><p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/rolling-ronny">Source</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
