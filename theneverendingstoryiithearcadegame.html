The concept is simple: you're Bastian, and are called forth once again by the Childlike Empress to save Fantasia, the Land of Dreams. The game itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a "book".</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Linel</p><p>Release Date: 1990</p><p>Platforms: C64, DOS, ZX Spectrum</p><p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/neverending-story-ii-the-arcade-game">Source</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
