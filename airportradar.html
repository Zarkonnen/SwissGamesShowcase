        <h1>Airport Radar</h1>
        <div class="big_card"><div class="big_card_left"><div class="big_card_picture"></div><p>Playing as an air traffic controller you can visit and operate in a variety of famous airports worldwide, but your thirst for efficiency and safety is paramount to your success. A pitstop in Dubai will almost certainly lead to a timed level in Japan. From O’Hare International Airport to Heathrow, players must balance incoming planes to a safe landing as other aircraft stack up. Though it looks like the simplest task ever, ask any air traffic controller - it’s one of the hardest jobs in the world! The key skill is mental fortitude: if you let flight safety go to your head you might lose your landing streak.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Looping</p><p>Publisher: Looping</p><p>Sponsor: Pro Helvetia</p><p>Release Date: 2021-12-01</p><p>Platforms: iOS</p><p><a href="https://looping.co">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.co/3vHJh91">App Store</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/looping_co">Twitter</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
