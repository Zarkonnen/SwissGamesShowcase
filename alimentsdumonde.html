In each level, the kid gets confronted with different menus, which they then need to prepare and cook. They can choose from a variety of regional products, of which they have to pick the right ones as ingredients for the desired dish. Then, they have to prepare the dish correctly.  There are are three difficulty modes: One for learning which ingredients they need for the dishes, a normal mode, and a difficult mode with a time limit.  The game was developed with the PHSZ for the nutrition museum Alimentarium in Vevey, Switzerland.  It's part of teaching documents, with corresponding work papers and a learning video. The corresponding teaching materials were created by the PHSZ.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Koboldgames</p><p>Release Date: 2015-08-26</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android, Browser, PC, Mac</p><p><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/23303403/Aliments-du-Monde">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://www.alimentarium.org/en/games/dishes-world">Other Store</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/aliments-du-monde/id1019469538">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.alimentarium.alimo">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
