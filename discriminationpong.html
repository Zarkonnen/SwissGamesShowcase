The GameArt project features some serious defects. It visualizes discrimination/racism, makes it playable and very tangible. The player experiences discrimination/racism first-hand while trying to establish a win in this unfair variation of Pong. The 'not so white-paddle' is discriminated in several aspects: from its visuals and its movements to the overall gamemechanic of the game. It is very hard for the discriminated player to win a match. Discrimination is implemented in different ways: the 'not-so-white-paddle' gets darker and darker. The left paddle may be slower than the right one. The ball may accelerate on the left side of the playground and become too fast to catch in time. The white paddle on the right may receive an extra ball without deserving it. And maybe worst of all, the ball never touches the right wall or paddle but loops slowly back to the left and takes on a faster pace as soon as it reaches the left side of the playground again. A very unfair game indeed! Find out what types of discrimination/racism you have to expect in DISCRIMINATION PONG. </p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: and-or</p><p>Release Date: 2010</p><p>Platforms: iOS, PC, Mac</p><p><a href="http://www.and-or.ch/discriminationpong/">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://www.and-or.ch/discriminationpong/downloads/DiscriminationPongGriffinPowerMate.zip">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
