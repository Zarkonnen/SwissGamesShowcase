Beautiful 32-bit 3d graphics and a nasty enemy AI help distinguish this game from similar ones. In addition to the standard turn left, turn right and accelerate forwards movement commands, it also features accelerate backwards, accelerate left, accelerate right and stop buttons. The game contains an infinite amount of computer-generated levels as well as several levels with written introductions that tell you the story of your voyage into the storm. As the game progresses, you will encounter dangerous remnants of the league war and the reason for the storm itself.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: David Stark</p><p>Release Date: 2001</p><p>Platforms: Mac OS 9</p><p><a href="https://zarkonnen.itch.io/asteroid-storm">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://zarkonnen.com/static/bumble/media/uploads/AsteroidStorm-121-ppc.sit">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
