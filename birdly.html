It`s a simple and strong story. People in every culture and of every age or social background have dreams of flying. It does not take many words to get involved: itâ€˜s the experience that matters!  Birdly is an immersive, full body installation born out of a research project. It explores the experience of a bird in flight and was developed by the Zurich University of the Arts (ZhdK). Unlike a common flight simulator you do not control a machine - you intuitively embody a bird. To evoke this sensation, Birdly relies on sensory-motor coupling and truly 3D visuals provided by a state of the art head mounted display. Birdly combines extended forms of storytelling with strong visuals and technical perfection to create a unique and intuitive experience.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Institute for Design Research ZHdK</p><p>Release Date: 2014</p><p>Platforms: Oculus Rift</p><p><a href="http://www.somniacs.co/">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
