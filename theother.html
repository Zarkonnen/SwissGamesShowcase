Sartre.  It has 3 levels of depth: emotional, psychological and philosophical. The Player can interact with 3 objects in the room... or not. Not  doing anything is also a choice. The next state of the Other and the  Room itself will depend on what the Player have done previously. The  Other remembers everything and responds accordingly.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Olga Brykina</p><p>Release Date: 2019-09-18</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac</p><p><a href="https://oriollie.io/projects/L2JaBv?album_id=1550875">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://ollie-oriollie.itch.io/the-other">itch.io</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
