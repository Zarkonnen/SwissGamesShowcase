The application is deliberately metaphorical and treats pathologies from a resolutely playful and light angle in order to gently address the seriousness of some of the diseases considered. The player is led to operate, with his breath, a small boat and to discover, along different routes, messages - fragments of stories - that will lead him to lighthouses stages, symbolizing the main respiratory pathologies. A logbook provides short information on each of the respiratory diseases and invites players to continue their search for information via our dedicated platform www.airia.ch. The application can be approached on two levels: by its playful aspect only (from 6 years old) and/or by its incentive character to a basic understanding of respiratory diseases (requires a good level of reading French).</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Tourmaline</p><p>Sponsor: LPGE</p><p>Release Date: 2018-10-04</p><p>Platforms: iOS, Android</p><p><a href="https://tourmaline-studio.com/en">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airia/id1435899865?l=fr&ls=1&mt=8">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.tourmaline.Souffle">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
