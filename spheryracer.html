In this interdisciplinary cooperation with sport scientists and game researchers of Sphery AG, the game is developed exclusively for Sphery's ExerCube, a fitness room where the game is projected on the walls. The software is tracking the player's performance with motion sensors and a heart rate tracker. The game then matches difficulty, complexity, speed, and sound to the performance during the workout, based on Sphery's elaborated Dual Flow training algorithm. This ensures an optimal training for body and mind, not too challenging but not to easy either.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Kobold Games</p><p>Sponsor: Sphery AG</p><p>Release Date: 2019-09</p><p>Platforms: ExerCube</p><p><a href="https://www.koboldgames.ch/project/spheryracer">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
