Actual experiments to create new types of honeybees that can resist certain parasites have been conducted. In our version, we played with the idea of a robotic bee that is sent into beehives in order to exterminate the hostile parasites within.  In traditional roguelike manner, we intended for the game to be difficult to master. In the end however, we managed that a bit too well and have created a game that borders on frustration in its difficulty.   The player moves from room to hexagonal room in a level, only able to leave rooms once all enemies within have been defeated. In some rooms, the player will encounter sick honeybees that can only be cured by draining life force from still living enemies.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Alice Ruppert, Martina Hugentobler</p><p>Release Date: 2015</p><p>Platforms: PC, Mac</p><p><a href="http://aliceruppert.ch/beest.html">Website</a></p><p><a href="http://aliceruppert.ch/beest.html">Download</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
