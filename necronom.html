There are a wide variety of targets to hit or avoid, some stationary, some with programmed attack paths and others with artificial intelligence to close in on you. The graphics have a very metallic look, similar to Cybernoid in a way. There aren't many power-ups on offer, and you aren't too dependent on them to be able to survive. However, an auto-fire joystick is strongly recommended.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Lunatic Software (England)</p><p>Publisher: Linel</p><p>Release Date: 1991</p><p>Platforms: Amiga</p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
