Spirit Fever players decide what cheerleading skill or activity to practice to increase the team level. Each practice element involves a mini-game that trains the player’s speed, comparison, calculation, and memory skills. Spirit Fever‘s goal is to train the cheerleaders and use their skills to compete against other players. The Spirit Fever site will also offer a variety of mini-games and a massive library of cheerleading videos and photos. Spirit Fever is the only Internet game where teenagers can safely learn about cheerleading while playing.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Joëlle Krummenacher, Florian Glardon</p><p>Sponsor: Flareware Cheer</p><p>Release Date: 2009-04-01</p><p>Early Access Date: 2009-01-30</p><p>Platforms: Browser</p><p><a href="http://www.spirit-fever.com/game/">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
