Streamf1sh1ng depicts a real-life pattern by pulling together individual fragments of reality into a virtual image. The fragments of reality are thoughts merged into a constant stream of words and thoughts. Making this stream of thoughts visible enables the individual thoughts to interact which each other. This means: the virtual image or world is revealed as an interactive reality of human being and machine and can be used for further communication and exchange of ideas.  You are fishing in a constant stream of thoughts. Catch someone else's thought and put it in your bucket or throw your own idea into the stream and see what happens. The constant stream is supplied by means of a search-engine. Any input in this particular search-engine will show up in the stream. Try to communicate via search-engine.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: and-or</p><p>Release Date: 2004-11-06</p><p>Platforms: Installation</p><p><a href="http://www.and-or.ch/streamfishing/">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
