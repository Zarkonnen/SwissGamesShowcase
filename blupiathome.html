The aim of the game is for the kid to associate each of the 26 letters to each of Blupi's 26 actions. Even if the child cannot read, it will very quickly know which letter leads to which action. For instance, if he presses B, Blupi will take a Bath. What's more, each action is brought up by a short sentence. Some actions lead to simple games : Draw with fun tools. Recognize numbers. Match a shape with its shadow. Spot the odd-one out.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Epsitec</p><p>Release Date: 1988</p><p>Platforms: Windows, Smaky</p><p><a href="http://www.ceebot.com/blupi/maison-e.php">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
