        <h1>Silly World Series</h1>
        <div class="big_card"><div class="big_card_left"><div class="big_card_picture"></div><p>Silly World Series is a collection of entertaining mini-games you can play with a group of friends of any age. Made for kids, teens, and adults, Silly World Series allows you to have some fun with your competitive side. You can try it out during your next party, get-together, reunion, or lunch break. It’s a completely addictive game that really tests your skills – once you get started, you won’t want to stop!  In this interactive game, you can choose one of eight different characters to play. Will you choose the Sparkly Rainbow Unicorn? Or maybe the Silly Hammerhead Shark? Silly World Series takes its players on a world trip through SillyLand, from the roaring Lachrymal Falls to the bubbly Verdant Swamp, from Red Stripe Canyon to Sharkfin Bay. Each of their diverse game settings are colorful, silly, and definitely amusing. All you need to get started is a smartphone, laptop (or smart TV), and an internet connection.  Just like any other platform, AirConsole is always developing the latest video games to provide you with the best entertainment for you so that you can play anytime, anyplace, and with any group of people. As of now, there are five games available for you and many more games are coming on board soon. So sit tight because you will not want to miss out on any of them.   1.  SILLY RUN VALLEY: It’s a long race to the finish line! To play this Silly World Series game, all you have to do is swipe up and down on your smartphone, which will allow you to stop your character from running into obstacles on the big screen. You also have to be on the lookout for the Bomb Bug, otherwise you may fall behind. Our advice is for you to shake them off, or most preferably you should pass them off to your competitors since the main aim of the game is for you to win. How far can you run?  2.  THE HUNGRY GAMES: The Hungry Games are all about reaction. If you are the type that loves fruit, then we just found the game for you. With this game, all you have to do is be the first to take down all the fruit that appears in the swamp to beat your friends and become the winner. However, you must be very careful because if you eat before you look, then you might end up catching a bomb instead. This will cause you to get knocked out of the game for a little while.  3.  CLIFF HANGER:  How good are you at dodging? Because you are going to be doing a lot of that with this mini-game in the Silly World Series! It is all about scaling rocks which protrude from the Lachrymal Waterfalls. All you have to do is swipe or move in the right direction to avoid colliding with the rocks. Making even just one wrong move can make you fall and lose the game.  4.  DERPY DANCING:  How confident are you with your memories? If you think your memory is as strong as a rock, then you should try this mini-game out. Derpy Dancing takes you directly to the sandy beaches of Sharkfin Bay, and this great game is all about putting your short term memory to the test!  Do you think you can remember more than your friends?  5.  HIDE AND SNEAK: How sneaky are you? Can you be as sneaky as the Great Tiger? Then you should put your sneakiness to the test with this game. You have to be the first to reach the grumpy turtle, Agnes, just to catch a ride with her across the Skeltara Desert. You have to tap repeatedly as fast as you possibly can to sneak up on her. But be careful to stop tapping on time so as to stop just about when she is about to look back. Test your timing and your agility with this fun Silly World Series game.  HOW TO PLAY SILLY WORLD SERIES WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS  You may have been wondering and asking yourself how exactly do you play these games and how to include your family and friends?
