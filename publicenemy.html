In this connection - we the developers - set a basic value on a dark and atmospheric game world and an interesting character development for the player. In this modification you will find two teams that play the basic role in this game and they will fight against each other in front of this futuristic scenery. But, Public-Enemy is not another Team-Deathmatch game it is much more than that. You will be a part of this world and based on the simple, but extensive character development it will be individual and not another clone. The graphic aspects, game play features and the design offer you new and interesting possibilities to explore the world of Public-Enemy.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Release Date: 2003-04-29</p><p>Platforms: Half-Life Mod</p><p><a href="http://www.ironoak.ch/PE/index.php?start=50&lang=engl">Website</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
