Alice’s attempt to hack into the LIBRIA Corp's protocol proved unsuccessful. She was then suddenly contacted by a mysterious underground organization calling itself “The Resistance”. Alice is in danger – LIBRIA has full control over the citizens and they know what she has done. The Resistance is certain: Alice’s actions will lead to a revolution.  To uncover the truth behind LIBRIA, Alice has to sneak past surveillance cameras, drones and security guards. While she makes her way through futuristic Zurich, the Resistance shows her the significance of several locations that led to the reformation – in the same place, 600 years ago.  The time has come to fight for liberty. Start a revolution.</p></div><div class="big_card_details"><p>Developer: Blindflug Studios</p><p>Release Date: 2017-11-03</p><p>Platforms: Android, iOS</p><p><a href="http://www.reformatzgame.ch/en/reformat-z-en/">Website</a></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/re-format-z/id1222873942">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blindflugstudios.renewalzh">Play Store</a></p></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
